        <p>I am a senior at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I am passionate about bridging the gap between <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>design</strong> in the ever-changing digital world. Committed to a career in computer science and adapting to constantly evolving <strong>technology</strong>, I possess an <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> mindset. With a solid foundation in design and a keen creative eye, my background uniquely positions me at a <strong>powerful</strong> intersection.
<br/><br/>
          Before coming to <strong>Boston</strong>, my first 18 years were spent in Pennsylvania, in the suburbs of Philly, participating in numerous sports, exploring artistic endeavors, and fueling my competitive mentality with board games, puzzles, and other activities. Aside from school and work, I enjoy playing volleyball, running, traveling, exploring Boston with friends, and finding new <strong>creative</strong> projects.
